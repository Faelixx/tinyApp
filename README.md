# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).
Create a username to save/share your personal and protected URLs.

Once you create a URL, you can insert the URL link into any address bar and you will be directed to the website that the shortened URL is assigned to! 

#### Example: 

https://localhost:1337/u/6hagm8 ---Directed To---> http://www.facebook.com .

* Note, above URL is invalid :3
